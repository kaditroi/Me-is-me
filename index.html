  <p> <em>Lifelong learner that delights in practical skills development.</em></p>
  <p>I am an aspiring web developer and programmer, learning all I can. My skills run the gamut from website building with WIX, Wordpress, and Webs to setting up email servers and Google apps to in-person and remote tech support using tools such as
    Zoho Assist and Teamviewer. I speak two languages and take really good candid <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/kaditroi/">photos.</a> I've built a couple of <a href=web-development.html>websites</a> on a few different platforms.</p>

  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  <p>Considering that ALL my positions are current positions and I have two children, I don't have much time for hobbies. That being said, these are the things I like to do when I have 3 seconds to myselfðŸ˜ƒ</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading...everything, especially Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels. Once I got so starved for materials I started reading phone books.</li>
    <li>Horseback Riding</li>
    <li>Karate...specifically Wado-Ryu. Health issues have sidelined that particular hobby.</li>
    <li>Bike Riding...leisurely, not competitive. See above re: health issues, haven't done this in a while.</li>
    <li>Swimming</li>
    <li>Machine Embroidery....like graphic design, but instead of a printer your designs come out in thread!</li>
    <li>Clarinet, guitar, piano playing. Not great, but I like it and am learning more every single day. So many great apps make it easier to learn on your own.</li>
    <li>Camping...only in a tent. Can it be considered camping if you have all the comforts of home?</li>
  </ul>
